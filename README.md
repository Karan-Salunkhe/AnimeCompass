# üéØ User-Empowered Anime Recommender

For my [Metis](https://www.thisismetis.com/data-science-bootcamps) final project, I developed an **interactive anime recommender system** that helps users discover personalized anime recommendations. This project addresses the business problem of **matching users with content they are likely to enjoy**, which is crucial for platforms like MyAnimeList or streaming services that rely on user engagement for growth and monetization.

The recommender combines **content-based filtering** (analyzing anime features like genre, episodes, and ratings) and **collaborative filtering** (leveraging patterns from similar users). Users can select how **adventurous** they want their recommendations to be:  

- **More adventurous**: Higher weight on collaborative filtering to suggest lesser-known or unexpected titles.  
- **More conservative**: Higher weight on content-based filtering to suggest titles similar to the user's past preferences.  

By giving users control over recommendation type, the system improves engagement and satisfaction, which is a key business driver for anime platforms.

To learn more about the methodology, see my [blog post](https://binhhoang.io/blog/anime-recommender/).

## üíº Business Problem

Anime platforms and streaming services face the challenge of **keeping users engaged** by recommending content that aligns with their tastes. Poor recommendations can reduce user engagement and limit revenue opportunities.  

This project addresses the question:  

> *How can we deliver personalized anime recommendations that balance familiarity with exploration to increase user engagement?*

By combining content-based and collaborative filtering, the system helps:  

- Users discover **anime they are likely to enjoy**  
- Platforms increase **user engagement and retention**  
- Platforms surface **lesser-known anime** effectively
